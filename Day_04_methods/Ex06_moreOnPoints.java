/* 

Write a program in which you create and use a class called Point, with two fields of type 
double (e.g. x, y) and the following methods:

distanceTo(Point): calculates the distance to another point.

distanceToOrigin(): calculates the distance to the origin. Implement it by calling the first 
method. 

moveTo(double x, double y): changes the coordinates of this point to be the given parameters
x and y. 

moveTo(Point): changes the coordinates of this point to move where the given point is.
4

clone(): returns a copy of the current point with the same coordinates.

opposite(): returns a copy of the current point with the coordinates multiplied by âˆ’1.

Two methods in a class can have the same name (identifier) as long as their parameters are 
different. This is called method overloading and we will see more of that in the future.
