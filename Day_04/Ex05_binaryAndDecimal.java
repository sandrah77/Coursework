/* 

Binary numbers can be quite long. A 32-bit memory address looks like 
1001 0101 0110 1010 1011 0010 1001 1010, which is difficult to handle. 
That is why memory addresses and other binary numbers are usually written as hexadecimal 
numbers. An hexadecimal number is a base-16 number, with digits between 0 and f 
(f is equivalent to decimal 15, e is equivalent to decimal 14, and so on). 
An hexadecimal number is equivalent to a four-digit binary number, which makes them quite 
compact. The former address reads 956ab29a, which is easier to read and write. 
To prevent confusion with decimal numbers, hexadecimal numbers are usually prefixed by “0x”,
as in 0x95 (which is 149) or 0xff (which is 255).

Write a program that takes a String. The string can be a decimal or a hexadecimal number 
(starting by “0x”). Your program must recognise the number as what it is and convert it to 
the other base. Use two methods for conversion as in the former exercise.
