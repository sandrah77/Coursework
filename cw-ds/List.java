/**
 * A list is a collection of objects that are sorted and can be
 * accessed by index. The first element in the list is at index 0.
 *
 * A list can store objects of any kind, and they can be of different
 * types: Integers, Doubles, String, or even other lists. However,
 * this list cannot store null objects.
 * 
 * There is no limit to the number of elements in the list (provided
 * that there is free memory in the Java Virtual Machine).
 * 
 * Not all operations on a list will always be successful. For
 * example, a programmer may try to remove an element from an empty
 * list, or from a position where there is nothing. Since we hace not
 * covered exceptions yet, we need another mechanism to report
 * errors. In order to do that, methods of this list will return a
 * {@see ReturnObject} that will contain either an object or an error
 * value of the right kind (as defined in {@see ErrorMessage}).
