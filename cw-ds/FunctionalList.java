/**
 * A functional list is a list with a few additional methods that are
 * common in functional languages (such as Lisp, Clojure, or Haskell)
 * to work with lists in a recursive way. 
 *
 * Not all operations on a recursive list will always be
 * successful. For example, a programmer may try to extract the head
 * from an empty list. Since we hace not covered exceptions yet, we
 * need another mechanism to report errors. In order to do that,
 * methods of this list will return a {@see ReturnObject} that will
 * contain either an object or an error value of the right kind (as
 * defined in {@see ErrorMessage}).
