/*
Make a class MatrixChecker with three methods:

• isSymmetrical(int[]) takes an array of int and returns true if the array
 is symmetrical and false otherwise. An array is symetrical if the element
 at [0] is the same as the element at [length-1], the element at [1] is 
 the same as the element at [length-2], etc.

• isSymmetrical(int[][]) takes an bidimensional array of int and returns 
true if the matrix is symmetrical and false otherwise. An matrix is 
symmetrical if m[i][j] == m[j][i] for any value of i and j.

• isTriangular(int[][]) takes an bidimensional array of int and returns
 true if the matrix is triangular1 and false otherwise. An matrix is 
 triangular if m[i][j] == 0 for any value of i that is greater than j.

Add some methods to your Matrix class from the other exercise to perform
tests on the matrices you create using the methods from MatrixChecker. 
(Hint: these methods will need to create objects of type MatrixChecker).
